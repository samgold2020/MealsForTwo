Project Description: 
Whether it's trying to choose what show to watch or whether or not the actually dog needs to go to doggy daycare three times a week, coming to an agreement with your partner can be difficult! Get ahead of the dinnertime argument with MealForTwo, an application that randomly generates a recipe and ingredient list for you and yours. Search by main ingredient, type of cuisine, or use our random meal generator and let fate decide!

User Stories: 

As a user, I want to randomly generate a dinner recipe that has all ingredients and cooking instructions listed, so that I don't have to choose what to cook for dinner.
As a user, I want to look up a specific type of cuisine and be presented with different options within that category, so that I can decide what to serve for dinner.
As a user, I want to search a dish by name, so that I can get the recipe list and cooking instructions for a particular dish.
As a user, I want to save my favorite recipes so that I can easily access them again.

MVP Goals:
Create an app that allows the user to generate a random meal, which consists of ingredients an instructions for cooking
Create an app that allows the user to search by keyword ingredient, which returns all recipes that contain that keyword ingredient and cooking instructions.

Stretch Goals
As a user, I want to list all the ingredients I don't like and have recipes with these ingredients removed from my list of options for all returns.
As a user, I want to tell the app what category of food I'd like to cook and have it randomly generate a recipe based on category and keywords (ex: french & chicken)
As a user, I want the recipe to dynamically update for the number of people I am cooking for.
As a user, I want to know the source of the recipe so that I can look into buying a cookbook if applicable.
As a user, I want recommended wine pairings for each dish, broken out into low, medium, and high tier wines.
Create an app that allows the user to search by name, which returns ingredients and cooking instructions.
